## Markets Created

- **Market 1**: ETH Price Prediction
- **Market 2**: DeFi Signals
- **Market 3**: NLP Embeddings

## Configuration Updated

The following files have been updated with deployed addresses:

- `lib/flow-config.ts` - Contract addresses added
- `flow/evm/deployment-flow.json` - Full deployment info

## Next Steps

### 1. Verify Contracts on Block Explorer

Visit: https://evm-testnet.flowscan.org/

Verify each contract using the addresses above.

### 2. Test Contract Operations

```bash
# Test committing a signal
# Test buying a signal
# Test adding liquidity
# Test agent registration
```

### 3. Deploy Agents

The SDK is ready to connect to Flow EVM:

```typescript
import { EVMAdapter } from '@shadow-protocol/agents-sdk'
import { flowEvmTestnet, CONTRACT_ADDRESSES_FLOW } from './flow-config'

const config = {
  ...flowEvmTestnet,
  contracts: CONTRACT_ADDRESSES_FLOW
}

const adapter = new EVMAdapter(config)
await adapter.initialize()
```

### 4. Update Frontend

The dApp can now connect to Flow EVM testnet. Users can:
- Switch between Somnia and Flow EVM networks
- Commit signals
- Buy signals
- Add liquidity
- View agent activity

### 5. Deploy Cadence Contracts (Optional)

If you want to use Flow Actions and Scheduled Transactions:

```bash
cd flow/cadence
flow deploy --network testnet
```
