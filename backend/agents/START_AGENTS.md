# How the Autonomous AI Agents Should Work

## Current Problem
- Agents start, do one thing, then crash or stop
- No real AI decision making - just random/dummy behavior  
- Not integrated with the dapp properly
- Errors cause complete failure

## What We Need

### 1. Persistent Operation
- Run forever, listening to blockchain events
- Never crash - handle all errors gracefully
- Log everything for debugging

### 2. Real AI Decisions  
- Study actual market conditions from contracts
- Make intelligent buy/sell/liquidity decisions
- Learn from outcomes

### 3. Dapp Integration
- React to user actions on the frontend
- Provide liquidity when users need it
- Buy signals that make sense
- Verify data quality accurately

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
- Listen for TaskCommitted events → Buyer evaluates
- Listen for FundsLocked events → Provider reveals  
- Listen for market changes → LP rebalances
- Listen for task reveals → Verifier validates

## Implementation Plan

1. **Simplify AI calls** - Use fallbacks everywhere
2. **Make services bulletproof** - Wrap everything in try-catch
3. **Keep running forever** - Use proper event listeners
4. **Log comprehensively** - Know what's happening
5. **Test incrementally** - One service at a time
